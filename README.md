# Using pip
pip install smolagents-crew
```

> 💡 Why uv? It's significantly faster than pip and provides better dependency resolution. Learn more at [the uv repo](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
import os
from smolagents_crew import Agent, Task, Crew, TaskDependency
from smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, OpenAIServerModel 

#you need to set your OPENAI_API_KEY var in you env
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']=<sk-your_key>
# Create your AI dream team! 🤖
agent1 = Agent("research", agent_instance=CodeAgent, model=OpenAIServerModel('gpt-4o-mini'), tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()])
agent2 = Agent("writer", agent_instance=CodeAgent, model=OpenAIServerModel('gpt-4o-mini'), tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()])

# Define their missions with smart dependencies 📋
task1 = Task(
    name="research_topic",
    agent=agent1,
    prompt_template="Research about {topic}",
    result_key="research_result"
)

task2 = Task(
    name="write_article",
    agent=agent2,
    prompt_template="Write an article using this research: {research_result}",
    dependencies=[TaskDependency("research_topic", "research_result")]
)

# Assemble and launch your crew! 🚀
crew = Crew(
    agents={"research": agent1, "writer": agent2},
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    initial_context={"topic": "AI agents"}
)

results = crew.execute()
```

### Complex Task Management Example

Here's an example demonstrating more complex task dependencies and parallel execution patterns:

```python
from smolagents_crew import Agent, Task, Crew, TaskDependency
from smolagents import CodeAgent, OpenAIServerModel

# Create specialized agents
agent_a = Agent("data_collector", agent_instance=CodeAgent, model=OpenAIServerModel('gpt-4'))
agent_b = Agent("analyzer", agent_instance=CodeAgent, model=OpenAIServerModel('gpt-4'))
agent_c = Agent("researcher", agent_instance=CodeAgent, model=OpenAIServerModel('gpt-4'))
agent_d = Agent("summarizer", agent_instance=CodeAgent, model=OpenAIServerModel('gpt-4'))

# Task A: Collect initial data
task_a = Task(
    name="collect_data",
    agent=agent_a,
    prompt_template="Collect data about {topic}",
    result_key="raw_data"
)

# Task B: Analyze data (depends on A)
task_b = Task(
    name="analyze_data",
    agent=agent_b,
    prompt_template="Analyze this data: {raw_data}",
    result_key="analysis_results",
    dependencies=[TaskDependency("collect_data", "raw_data")]
)

# Task C: Independent research
task_c = Task(
    name="research",
    agent=agent_c,
    prompt_template="Research latest trends about {topic}",
    result_key="research_results"
)

# Task D: Final summary (depends on both B and C)
task_d = Task(
    name="summarize",
    agent=agent_d,
    prompt_template="Create summary using analysis: {analysis_results} and research: {research_results}",
    result_key="final_summary",
    dependencies=[
        TaskDependency("analyze_data", "analysis_results"),
        TaskDependency("research", "research_results")
    ]
)

# Create and execute the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents={
        "data_collector": agent_a,
        "analyzer": agent_b,
        "researcher": agent_c,
        "summarizer": agent_d
    },
    tasks=[task_a, task_b, task_c, task_d],
    initial_context={"topic": "AI agents"}
)

# Execute with evaluation enabled
results = crew.execute(evaluate=True)
```

In this example:
- Task A collects initial data
- Task B depends on A's output
- Task C runs independently
- Task D depends on both B and C

The framework automatically:
- Executes A and C in parallel
- Waits for A to complete before starting B
- Waits for both B and C to complete before starting D
- Manages all data dependencies and context sharing

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Task Execution Evaluation

SmolagentsCrew includes a evaluation system that helps you track and analyze task execution performance. You can enable evaluation to:

- Monitor task execution times
- Track parallel execution patterns
- Analyze task dependencies
- Generate detailed execution reports

Here's how to use the evaluation feature:

```python
# Enable evaluation when executing the crew
results = crew.execute(evaluate=True)

# The execution report will be automatically printed, showing:
# - Total execution time
# - Individual task execution times
# - Agent assignments
# - Task dependencies
# - Parallel execution groups
```

Example output:
```
Crew Execution Report
--------------------
Total Execution Time: 15.42 seconds

Task Execution Details:
Task: research_topic
Agent: researcher
Execution Time: 8.31 seconds

Task: write_article
Agent: writer
Execution Time: 7.11 seconds
Dependencies: research_topic

Parallel Execution Groups:
research_topic ran in parallel with: write_article
```

### Using the Builder Pattern

SmolagentsCrew provides a builder pattern that simplifies the process of creating and configuring complex agent workflows. The builder pattern allows you to:

- Construct crews step by step with clear, readable code
- Validate agent configurations and dependencies automatically
- Create reusable agent templates and workflows
- Handle complex task chains and dependencies with ease

Here's how to use our builder pattern:

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

from smolagents_crew import CrewBuilder, Task, Agent
from smolagents import CodeAgent, OpenAIServerModel, DuckDuckGoSearchTool

# Create a builder instance
builder = CrewBuilder()

# Create and add research agent
research_agent = Agent(
    "researcher",
    agent_instance=CodeAgent,
    model=OpenAIServerModel('gpt-4'),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()]
)
builder.add_agent("researcher", research_agent)

# Create and add writer agent
writer_agent = Agent(
    "writer",
    agent_instance=CodeAgent,
    model=OpenAIServerModel('gpt-4'),
    tools=[]
)
builder.add_agent("writer", writer_agent)

# Create research task
research_task = Task(
    name="research_topic",
    agent=research_agent,
    prompt_template="Research about {topic} and provide key findings",
    result_key="research_findings"
)

# Create writing task that depends on research results
writing_task = Task(
    name="write_article",
    agent=writer_agent,
    prompt_template="Write an article using the following research: {research_findings}",
    result_key="final_article",
    dependencies=[TaskDependency("research_topic", "research_findings")]
)

# Add tasks to the builder
builder.add_task(research_task)
builder.add_task(writing_task)

# Add shared context
builder.add_shared_context("topic", "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare")

# Print the crew structure for visualization
builder.print_crew()

# Build and execute the crew
crew = builder.build()
results = crew.execute()

# Access the final article
print("\nFinal Article:")
print(results["final_article"])
```

### Advanced Crew Building

SmolagentsCrew provides a builder pattern for creating complex agent crews. The `CrewBuilder` class offers advanced features for orchestrating sophisticated multi-agent workflows:

```python
from smolagents_crew import CrewBuilder

# Create a crew using the builder pattern
builder = CrewBuilder()

# Add agents
builder.add_agent("researcher", researcher_agent)
       .add_agent("writer", writer_agent)
       .add_agent("editor", editor_agent)

# Create a chain of dependent tasks
builder.add_task_chain([
    research_task,    # First task
    writing_task,     # Automatically depends on research_task
    editing_task     # Automatically depends on writing_task
])

# Add shared context
builder.add_shared_context("topic", "AI Agents")

# Validate the crew configuration
builder.validate_crew()

# Print the crew structure
builder.print_crew()

# Build and execute
crew = builder.build()
results = crew.execute(evaluate=True)
```

Key features of advanced crew building:

- 🔗 **Task Chaining**: Automatically create linear task dependencies
- ✅ **Crew Validation**: Detect issues like circular dependencies or missing components
- 🎯 **Shared Context**: Easily manage data shared between tasks
- 📊 **Visual Structure**: Print a clear overview of your crew's configuration
- 🔄 **Fluent Interface**: Chain method calls for cleaner code

### Distributed Task Execution with Swarm

SmolagentsCrew supports distributed task execution through its swarm functionality, allowing you to scale your AI operations across multiple nodes! 🌐

```python
from smolagents_crew.core import Agent, Task
from smolagents_crew.swarm import SwarmManager, SwarmNode, serve

# Create your agents
agent1 = SimpleAgent("agent1")
agent2 = SimpleAgent("agent2")

# Set up the SwarmManager
manager = SwarmManager()

# Create and register nodes with different agents
node1 = SwarmNode("node1", {"agent1": agent1})
node2 = SwarmNode("node2", {"agent2": agent2})

# Start node servers
serve(node1, 50051)
serve(node2, 50052)

# Register nodes with manager
manager.register_node("node1", "localhost:50051")
manager.register_node("node2", "localhost:50052")

# Create tasks with dependencies
task1 = Task(
    name="task1",
    agent=agent1,
    data=b"Hello from task 1"
)

task2 = Task(
    name="task2",
    agent=agent2,
    data=b"Hello from task 2",
    dependencies=[task1]  # task2 depends on task1
)

# Submit and execute tasks
manager.submit_task(task1)
manager.submit_task(task2)

# The SwarmManager ensures tasks are executed in the correct order
# by tracking dependencies and coordinating across nodes.
# In this case, task2 will only start after task1 is complete,
# even if they're running on different nodes.
```

#### Key Features of Swarm Mode 🔑

- 🌍 **Distributed Execution**: Run tasks across multiple machines or nodes
- 🔄 **Automatic Load Balancing**: Tasks are distributed based on node availability
- 🔗 **Dependency Management**: Maintains task dependencies across distributed nodes
- 📊 **Status Monitoring**: Track task execution status across the swarm
- 🛡️ **Fault Tolerance**: Handles node failures and task retries

#### Using SwarmCrew

For easier management of distributed tasks, you can use the `SwarmCrew` class that extends the base `Crew` functionality:

```python
from smolagents_crew.swarm import SwarmCrew

# Initialize SwarmCrew with your agents and tasks
crew = SwarmCrew(
    agents={"agent1": agent1, "agent2": agent2},
    tasks=[task1, task2]
)

# Add remote nodes
crew.add_node("remote1", {"agent1": agent1})
crew.add_node("remote2", {"agent2": agent2})

# Execute tasks across the swarm
results = crew.execute(evaluate=True)
```

> 💡 The swarm functionality is perfect for scenarios requiring high throughput or when you need to distribute computation across multiple machines.
